# Project specific details

The main file of this project is the `abstract.Rmd` file. All analyses can be
included there, as well as the write up. Since this file is a R Markdown file,
all tables, figures, and calculations can be inserted into the final document
format using `rmarkdown::render('abstract.Rmd')` or by typing `Ctrl-Shift-K` in
RStudio. This will create the file suitable for submission to whichever location
the abstract is for.
