# Project specific details

For this manuscript project, the main files are found in the `doc/` folder. This
folder contains the manuscript as well as additional exploratory
analysis files. Any of these `.Rmd` files and the R code within can be computed
and converted into different document formats by running
`rmarkdown::render('manuscript.Rmd')` or typing `Ctrl-Shift-K` in RStudio. This
approach simplifies the submission process. This workflow also allows the use of
templates based on the journal's submission requirements via the R Markdown
`reference_docx` YAML option.
