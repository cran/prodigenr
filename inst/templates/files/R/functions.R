# Description of functions file -------------------------------------------
#
# This contains custom functions used for this project's analyses. These are all
# loaded from the `.Rprofile` file at the start of the session and can be loaded
# using `source()`. It's recommended that if a piece of code is used more than
# once in your analysis files, make it into a function and put it here so that
# you "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY principle).
#
# Use RStudio's R script 'Insert Section' (Ctrl-Shift-R) to split up your
# functions by utility or purpose. You can see the contents of this file easily
# using the 'Document Outline' (Ctrl-Shift-O), which shows the sections and
# functions.
