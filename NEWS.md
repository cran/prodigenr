# prodigenr 0.3.0

## New features/functionality

* `prodigen()` now creates a new project structure that mimics R package development
more, specifically `devtools` (since it is well documented and actively
maintained) (#18, #15, #14). The old style has been removed.
* Added a function to include a [STROBE](http://www.strobe-statement.org/index.php?id=strobe-home) 
checklist for  reporting guidelines (#21).
* Added function to include an `rfigshare` script to send to [figshare](https://figshare.com/) (#19).
* Added function to include a more complete MIT license (#20).

# prodigenr 0.2.7

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Fixed a bug that prevented an Rproj file and the Rprofile files from being
installed and created.
